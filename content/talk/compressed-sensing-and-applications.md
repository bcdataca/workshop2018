In the last decade, sparse recovery techniques have proved increasingly popular
for extracting low-dimensional features from high-dimensional data.
Furthermore, there is now a rich mathematical theory underlying these
techniques, often referred to as compressed sensing.  In this talk, I will give
an overview of compressed sensing and sparse recovery, highlighting both the
main techniques and the fundamental mathematics.  In the second half of the
talk I will focus on a number of recent extensions and applications, with the
aim being to demonstrate how to leverage additional benefits via more refined
structured sparsity models.

### Speaker Bio

[Ben Adcock](https://benadcock.org/) is an assistant professor at Simon Fraser
University.  He studied mathematics at the University of Cambridge, receiving
his BA in 2005, his MMath in 2006, and his PhD in 2011. He held NSERC and PIMS
postdoctoral fellowships at Simon Fraser University from 2010 to 2012, and was
an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics at Purdue University
from 2012 to 2014, before returning to Canada in August of that year.  He was
the recipient of a Leslie Fox Prize in Numerical Analysis in 2011, an Alfred
P. Sloan Research Fellowship in 2015 and the CAIMS-PIMS Early Career Award
in 2017.  His research interests include applied and computational harmonic
analysis, numerical analysis and approximation theory.
