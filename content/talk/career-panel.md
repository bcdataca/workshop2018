## Summary


On the evening of June 6th, BC Data Science workshop participants
gathered at [KPMG headquarters](https://goo.gl/maps/8qcjD5NUwRF2)
for a career panel and social event. The panel discussed non-academic
career options for math-inclined folk; how to be prepared
for industry jobs and job interviews; and what differences to expect
in industry. More broadly, the panelists discussed career success,
personal values, and strategies for achieving career-oriented goals.

The panel included folk with a range of perspectives: from long-time industry
folk to recent graduates in mathematics/statistics now working in industry. It
included current and past employees of major tech companies and current start-up
leadership roles. See below for [panelists](./#our-panelists) and [speaker bios](./#speaker-bios).

After the moderated portion of the career panel, a lively and engaging reception followed a student Q&A session.

electives.


Dr. Aanchan Mohan is a machine learning scientist and software engineer at
Synaptitude Brain Health. He is currently working on software and machine
learning methods to encourage circadian regulation with the goal of improving an
individual’s brain health. His current research interests include problems in
natural language processing. Dr. Mohan has worked on Bayesian and deep learning
methods applied to time series signals across multiple domains. He holds a PhD
from McGill University where he focused on transfer learning and parameter
sharing in acoustic models for speech recognition. He supervises students and
actively publishes in the area of speech processing. He is a named co-inventor
on two issued patents in the area of speech processing, and one filed patent in
the area of wearable devices. He is a co-organizer of the AI in Production, and
Natural Language Processing meetups in Vancouver.

### Moderated Questions

1. What was the first job you had after graduation and how did you get it? 
2. What do you like most/least about your current work?
3. If you could go back in time and change one thing about your career choices what would you do?
4. What advice do you have for the students in the audience looking for their first job?
