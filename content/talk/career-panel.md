## Career panel at KPMG

<!--{{< youtube ctOFh51xzmM >}}-->

## Summary

On the evening of June 5th, BC Data Science workshop participants
will gather at [KPMG headquarters](https://goo.gl/maps/8qcjD5NUwRF2)
for a career panel and social event. The panel discusses non-academic
career options for math-inclined folk; how to be prepared
for industry jobs and job interviews; and what differences to expect
in industry. More broadly, the panelists discussed career success,
personal values, and strategies for achieving career-oriented goals.

The panel includes folk with a range of perspectives: from long-time industry
folk to recent graduates in mathematics/statistics now working in industry. It
includes current and past employees of major tech companies and current start-up
leadership roles.
