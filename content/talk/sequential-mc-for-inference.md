### Speaker Bio

[Dr. Bhushan Gopaluni](http://www.chbe.ubc.ca/profile/bhushan-gopaluni/) is a
Professor in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at UBC,
working with the
[Data Analytics and Intelligent Systems](http://dais.chbe.ubc.ca/) lab.

Dr. Gopaluniâ€™s primary research interests are in Process Modeling and
Control. He is interested in developing and studying the properties of
data-based models for a variety of chemical and biological systems. These
systems are typically nonlinear, hybrid and time varying, and their
measurements are often noisy and irregular. The thrust of his research is on
developing high quality models for such processes and adapting them to reflect
process changes. His research interests also span a wide range of other areas
including identification for control, model predictive controllers, adaptive
control, and performance monitoring and assessment.
