# About

Targeted at students from PIMS institutions with an interest in data science and
strong mathematical backgrounds, the 2018 PIMS BC Data Science Workshop has two
goals: to bring together top students and industry professionals to tackle
interesting research and industry problems; and to develop data science literacy
in students with strong mathematical skills who may have little or no previous
experience in the realm of "data science".

This workshop will give students experience with data science tools &mdash; such
as working with large data sets, statistical inference, and machine learning
&mdash; that will be helpful in their research, as well as in their career
options after graduation. For more information on workshop content, visit the
[posts](#posts) section, [schedule](#schedule), or see [below](#info) for
additional information.
