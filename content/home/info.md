# Summary

This one-week workshop will include both theoretical and practical components.
Data sets and problems from industry and government will be introduced by guest
speakers.

Computational work will be done with Jupyter notebooks using
[bcdata.syzygy.ca](https://bcdata.syzygy.ca). Participants will have the
opportunity to work with big data, and learn subsequent analysis motifs using
machine learning, data clustering, parameter fitting, and other techniques.

See below for a [detailed schedule](#schedule). Lecture notes and workshop
materials can be found on the [associated GitHub
repository](https://github.com/bcdataca/workshop-content). Last year's [workshop homepage](http://workshop.bcdata.ca/2017/) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bcdataca/workshop-content) are also available.
