### Mentor: Bernard Chan, BuildDirect

## Summary

### About BuildDirect

BuildDirect is the first technology platform for the home improvement
industry. The BuildDirect platform includes two core business units:

* BuildDirect Marketplace: An online marketplace that offers Pro Buyers and
  Homeowners the ability to purchase heavyweight home improvement products
  direct from Sellers and receive efficient direct-to-home (or jobsite) shipping
  of those products.
* Gateway Supply Chain: The first anywhere-to-the-home supply chain for heavy
  and bulky goods that equips manufacturers, distributors and retailers with
  efficient and cost-effective shipping solutions to move their products from
  anywhere in the world, to locations across North America.

The platform is powered by proprietary machine learning and predictive analytics
that drive robust efficiencies for the innovation of heavyweight product
services, distribution, and sales across buyers, sellers, shippers, and everyone
in between.

BuildDirect is headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia with warehouse
locations across North America.

### About the Data Science Problem

Home improvement products are larger and builkier than the typical goods sold
online. Because of their size and weight, instead of fulfilling orders via
postal or express carriers, orders at BuildDirect are shipped by freight
carriers. As a result, shipping costs at BuildDirect, both in terms of dollar
value and as the percentage of the total cost, are higher than other online
retailers.

With the provided data set, we would like understand how shipping costs effect
BuildDirect customers' behaviour. Specifically, we would like to

1. understand if the current shipping strategies are effective and
2. optimize our shipping rates to increase sales and revenue. 

Given the open-ended nature of the proposed problems, methods and techniques
from mathematics, statistics, economics and machine learning are all applicable
