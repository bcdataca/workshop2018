### Mentor: Roger Donaldson, Midvale Applied Mathematics

## Summary

Despite our hand in their design, and hence their seemingly deterministic
operation, electronic systems grow ever more complex and are often most simply
characterized through measurement-driven modeling. This workshop presents
measurements of the rate at which bits are produced as output of a compression
algorithm for a digital video camera. The data are produced by presenting the
camera with a variety of test scenes, and operating it over a variety of
settings. The data presented here can both simulate the camera's bit rate as a
function of operating conditions for design purposes, as well as provide some
insight into how the camera's compression algorithm operates. 

Several other goals will be presented, and participants will be free to
investigate a variety of possible directions with the data.  Perhaps most
importantly, complete details of how the data are generated --- namely the
internal workings of the camera's algorithm --- are not available.  Despite this
fact, we believe that systems as elaborate as those that can control the
camera's bit rate under changing conditions can be achieved with good modeling
practice on these available data.
