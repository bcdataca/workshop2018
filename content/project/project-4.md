### Mentor: Jeff Epstein, Comm100


## Summary

Description: The data set provided includes thousands of online chat sessions
between support and sales agents of a company and their customers or online web
visitors. Each chat log includes [chat transcript, duration times, and customer
rating].  We’ve identified some business issues/use cases with suggested
solutions for you to solve but you are not limited to the following issues or
solutions (get creative! See things we don’t see in with the data that would
provide real business value):
 
1. Cluster or Correlate chat sessions:
    * Build an algorithm or methodology to cluster or correlate similar issues
      across chat sessions defined by you
2. Understand Chat Sentiment of chat sessions:
    * Develop a method of identifying client emotional state
3. We have a Knowledge Base (KB) tool but it is manual work on the client side
to create Q&A’s. Is there a way to progress towards full automation in building
a Knowledge Base with what’s already there?
    * Build a KB comprised of questions and their corresponding answers in an
      automated way.
