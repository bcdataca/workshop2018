**Project Room: ORCH 3068**

## Summary

Cytokines are a broad and loose category of small proteins that are important in
cell signaling. Their release has an effect on the behavior of cells around
them. The challenge in this problem is to find patterns of Single Nucleotide
Polymorphisms (SNPs: genotypes) that beget particular cytokine levels
(phenotypes).  Part of the data set provided is a list of patients' blood work
measurements (cytokine levels). These data are in a straightforward CSV
file. The other part of the dataset is genomic data of the patients.  These data
are large collections of SNP markers on the patients' genomes and are
represented in plink format, a common format for genome studies.  A part of the
work the students would have to do is to unpack the plink data into a useful
form for analysis. Finally, there is a genome reference online that indicates
what is known about each SNP marker. There are about 330 (anonymized) patients,
perhaps 40 cytokine markers, and entire genomes worth of data for each patient.

#### Data team notes

Some background with biochemistry, mathematical biology, genetics, etc. is
recommended.
