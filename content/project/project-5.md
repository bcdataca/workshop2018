### Mentor: Borhan Sanandaji

## Summary

* **Idea 1:** Characterize and visualize the make/model/year distribution in the dataset; extend this by characterizing the conditional distribution over the geographical span of the dataset.

* **Idea 2:** Determinine the devices in the dataset that have multiple drivers per mojio device

* **Idea 3:** (Optional) Using any of the existing variables in the dataset or outside resources, forecast the battery voltage of the vehicles. 

### About the data

~950k device messages each including 158 variables of 166 different cars sampled over 3 week time period.
